#RPI Homework LaTeX template

This is my custom LaTeX template for the following courses in RPI:

- CSCI 2200 Foundations of Computer Science
- ECSE 2010 Electric Circuits

##Installation

Please refer to the document of your own distribution of LaTeX.

I personally use MiKTeX, so I have set an environment variable `TEXINPUT` to my local repo.

##Contribution

Please don't hold back on suggestions, issues and pull requests.

##Memorable

This is my first independent original github repo.
